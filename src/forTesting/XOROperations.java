	3 EQUALLY SPACED(VERY VERY IMP) numbers (NOT NECESSARILY SORTED). 
	Hence if any two numbers are given then finding the 3rd number is easy 
	using XOR of the two given numbers
	
	In 3 numbers,
	
	a-----b------c
	
	If I want to find the middle number, then
	middle number = prev XOR next. Thus, to find middle[b], I should know prev[a] and next[c]
	any number = next XOR next.next . Thus, to find any number[a], I should know its next[b] and the next of next[c]
	any number = prev XOR prev.prev . Thus, to find any number[c], I should know its prev[b] and the prev of prev[a]
	
	This property of XOR is used in MEMORY EFFICIENT DOUBLY LINKED LIST
	
	
	NOTE: The missing number can only be found, if the numbers in the array start from 1 to n, where n = size of the array
